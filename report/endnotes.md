[^FNLHA]: the rental areas used here don't usually coincide with local authorities; the rent used is chosen randomly from those mapped to that local authority. See Fenton (2012) for a Local Authority to BRMA mapping; since Fenton is rather dated, on occassion a national average category A rent had to be used when no mapping was obvious.

[^JCODE1]: The code for this is in the Julia source file [StayingPutSim.jl](https://github.com/grahamstark/staying_put_sim/blob/master/src/StayingPutSim.jl)

[^OFSTED18]: OFSTED (2019), "Number of young people in foster care who became 18"

[^DFE18]: DFE 2019b, Underling Data, File "CareLeavers17182018_amended.csv", column "CL_Stayput_18"

[^FN200]: 200 iterations in the reported results

[^FNFEE]: an allowance is a per-child amount, a fee a per-carer amount; since we assume 1 child per carer on the staying put scheme there is no real difference in our modelling between the two.
