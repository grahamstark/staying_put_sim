## How We Modelled the Staying Put Scheme

In this section we discuss our model of staying put. We discuss:

* the available data, and how we worked round limitations in the data;
* our modelling strategy; and
* the assumptions we had to make and the effects of varying those assumptions.
*   

### Data Sources

We used three main sources of data on the existing Staying Put scheme, and on fostering in England more generally:

1. The [@ofsted_fostering_2019] "Fostering in England" Series. OFSTED are resposible for the monitoring of the foster care system in England. They publish local-authority level information on the performance of foster care services (both Local Authority and private). We use their for some baseline numbers of numbers of carers and young people in the system, and we we use OFTSTED data to make crude imputations of (e.g) foster carer skill levels;
1. Department For Education (DFE) "Looked-after children" series [@dfe_statistics:_2019], [@department_for_education_looked-after_2018]. In particular we use the "Underlying Data" series which has the most detail on numbers on the staying put scheme by local authority and age. We use this for entry and exit rates from the scheme, and optionally for some baseline numbers of young people on the scheme, since the DFE numbers appear not to be always consistent with the OFSTED numbers;
1. The Fostering Network's 2017 Survey of local authorities in England [@fostering_network_foster_2017]. We were given access to the underlying dataset. We use this for information on how each English council implements payments for the Staying Put scheme.

In addition we've used data on:

* grants to local authorities [@dfe_staying_2019];
* local housing allowance levels [@valuation_office_agency_local_2019];
* minimum wage rates[@hmrc_national_2019];
* benefit rates [@dwp_benefit_2019];
* projected inflation [@obr_obr_2019];
* recommended minimum foster allowances [@dfe_foster_2019]

These are discussed below.

Getting all these data sources into a consistent format was not always straightforward. The three main sources listed above at times appeared to be inconsistent with each other.  The Fostering Network data, which is crucial given that it is our only disaggregated source on foster payments, required a lot of iterpretation before it could be used. There were also a number of essentially minor but nonetheless time-consuming issues merging local-authority level sources which used different names and codings.

### Modelling Strategy

We were tasked with providing local-authority and national- level five year forecasts for the costs of the staying put scheme under various possible systems of payment. Our strategy was to construct a synthetic dataset showing our estimate of the numbers on the staying put scheme by age, and the number of carers by skill level. Each carer and young person was modelled as an individual. Rules for payments to the carer and from the young person were then applied to each; these were either out interpretation of the rules from the Fostering Network survey, or the proposed Action for Children reforms.
