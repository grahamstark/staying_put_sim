## WHAT WE MODELLED

The Data and Modelling Strategy sections below discusses how our model was built. Here, we'll discuss how to interpret the results.

The options paper asked us to produce estimates for three schemes (and some variants):

1. the current scheme, projected forwards for five years;
2. a proposed comprehensive scheme covering the costs of staying put with both an allowance and a fee[^FNFEE].
3. a similar scheme to (3) but with a taper - lower total payments (not just fees) to carers after the first year of the scheme.

In the schemes 2 and 3, the Allowance is set so very carer is to be paid at least the minimum recommended by Department for Education for a 16 or 17-year-old (so £226 a week for carers based in London; £218 a week for the South East; and £194 a week for the rest of England)[@dfe_foster_2019]. There is no Government guidance on the fee part but there is some evidence in the Fostering Network survey discussed below on how they are implemented in practice; we model a fee based on the our understanding of the practice in Oldham: a there, fee payments are based on five skill levels, and for Staying Put  a full fee uis paid in the first year of the placement, 50% in the second, and none in the third.

With the exception of the taper in option (3) the reformed systems are modelled as minimum standards; where it appears that the existing systems are more generous for some local authority (LA), that system is retained.

## Outputs

Our model produces five main classes of output:

* A) Payments to carers;
* B) Gross Costs to LAs;
* C) Contributions from young people;
* D) Forecast Grants from central Government;
* E) Net Cost to local authorities

Formally:

    B = A-C

so, gross costs to LAs is the payments to carers, less contributions from young people (we make no attempt to estimate the overhead costs of social workers, administration, etc.).

    E = A-C-D

the net costs to LAs are the gross costs less grants from Central Government.

All numbers are in 'nominal terms' - projected actual cash payments, with fees, allowances and other amounts increased each year in line with forecast Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation using Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections [@obr_obr_2019]. We could easily strip out the effects of inflation to produce 'real terms' increases.

How we produced these is discussed in the next section.
