Dear Kate,

again, apologies for the lateness of this.

I attach two spreadsheets with updated cost estimates for the same schemes as previously, and also for a scheme where all young people contribute from Housing Benefits.

I was trying to think of a neat way of incorporating the situation where there are also u18 children (and so no extra fee for Staying Put carers). I've thought of a crude approach & will have some numbers to you later in the week.

For the grants, in absence of a new Grant Determination Letter, I've just added £10,000,000 pro-rata to the existing allocations and then, as before, for subsequent years moved the allocation in line with projected totals on the scheme.

My numbers are, as before, based on the DfE underlying data, in particular the series:

   `CL_Stayput_FFC_18` : 1,970 total cases in 2018/19 in England
   `CL_Stayput_FFC_19&20` 1,710 total cases.

So, 3,680 in total. My simulations produce numbers about 200 above these for 2020/21. Obviously all these numbers are bigger than the ones we discussed in London. This equates to an average modelled payment of £240pw under the current schemes and £386pw under our 'Oldham' scheme.
